# MRDC 911 Assignment 1 - EDA & Data Preprocessing on Kenyan Student Dataset


    This project explores academic, socioeconomic, and behavioral data of Kenyan university students using R. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing to prepare the dataset for potential modeling and gain insights on factors affecting student performance.

#requirements

    Make sure R and RStudio are installed. 
      install the following R packages:
      install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "corrplot"))
      library(tidyverse)
      library(ggplot2)
      library(corrplot)

#File Structure

    kenya_student_data.csv - Raw dataset
    
    R Script Answers.R - Full analysis script with code and comments
    
    kenya_student_data_preprocessed.csv - Cleaned dataset after preprocessing
    
    README.rd - This documentation

# This script answers the following key questions:

    Overview of dataset structure
    
    Summary statistics and visualizations
    
    Correlation analysis
    
    Tests for relationships (e.g., internet access vs. performance)
    
    Handling missing data and outliers
    
    Feature engineering (binning, total score)
    
    Preprocessed output saved as CSV 
    
#Key Findings
    Urban students study slightly more than rural ones.
    
    Students with internet access generally perform better.
    
    Family income and academic performance show a moderate relationship.
    
    Participation in extracurriculars tends to align with better academic outcomes.
    
    Strong correlation exists between study hours and academic success.
    
    Most students fall into "Average" or "Good" performance levels.

    Participation in extracurricular activities may align with higher performance.
    
    Internet access correlates positively with academic achievement.
    
#What i learnt 
- R is a bit hard at first but once you get used it's not so bad
- Plots really help in showing data better
- Missing values and outliers need to be fixed or they confuse the model
- People from urban and higher income areas sometimes do better, maybe because of more resources
